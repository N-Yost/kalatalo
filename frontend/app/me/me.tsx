                        I am a postdoctoral fellow living in Pasadena, since October 2012. I grew up in Michigan, moved to the Bay Area for graduate school, and have now moved south.<br /><br />
                        I've loved astronomy since the first time I saw Cosmos with Carl Sagan. It is what inspired me to pursue astronomy as a career, and launched me toward my Ph.D., which I completed in August 2012, from UC - Berkeley. I was mainly a radio astronomer, having logged over 100 hours at the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA). At this point I have worked with data that spans the electromagnetic spectrum, from optical spectra to X-rays to ultraviolet photometry to the far-IR. Caltech and Pasadena are doing a great job expanding my collaborations and knowledge, and I look forward to enjoying the time I do science here.

                        I have a lot of non-astronomy interests. Beginning from when I was young and horseback rode, became extremely involved in my high school's theatre program, and finally settled into science at university (while also never missing a football game. Go Blue!)<br /><br />
                        At Berkeley, I took up photography, became a stalker of the National Parks (life goal is to make it to all the classic national parks in the US), started wind-surfing (and real surfing, but that was mostly falling), and never turning down a chance to do something new or go somewhere unique. I also started going to concerts and Dubstep shows and developed a taste for Napa Cabs and fair trade artisan coffee. A tranquil day just being by the ocean is my ideal way to spend a day.

                        Now in Pasadena, we live just a little bit outside of Old Town. Besides the cats that have been with me for the last 10 years, we have added two new members of the clan. A Betta (Brutus, and if you have never had a Betta, you do not appreciate the smarmy personality of this fish), and our pound puppy, Oberon (Obie). Obie is a Corgi/Chihuahua mix and is afflicted with a disease known as "perma-cute". He loves his walks, and loves his people.<br /><br />
                        We're just getting used to our new environment. Between dog-walks and the rigors of postdoc-ing at Caltech, it will take me longer to get acquainted with LA the way that I am intimately acquainted with the Bay area. But Pasadena is growing on me, and without LA, we would not now have Obie.
